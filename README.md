## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Librosa 🎶 (audio feature extraction)
- Scikit-learn & Keras 🤖
- Flask 🌐 (backend deployment)
- HTML/CSS & GSAP ⚡ (frontend with animations)
- SQLite 🗄️ (for storage)

---

## ✨ Features

- Upload music files (MP3/WAV)
- Extract audio features (MFCC, ZCR, Spectral Centroid, etc.)
- Predicts the genre using a trained AI model
- Displays prediction with confidence
- Stylish UI with smooth GSAP animations
